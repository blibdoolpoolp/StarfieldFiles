# Blibdoolpoolp's Starfield Files
This is where I am going to keep my StarfieldCustom.ini, as well as my combined tweaks BAT file, as well as any other tweak files needed for my setup. I will include everything here for easy access to anyone who wants to play their game how I have mine setup. The actual mods that I have installed are the property of the original creators, and as such I will just be providing links and instructions on where to find them, and how to install them.
