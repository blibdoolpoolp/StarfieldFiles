1. Copy and paste StarfieldCustom.ini into your <C:\My Documents\My Games\Starfield> folder.
2. (Optional) Open StarfieldCustom.ini in text editor of your choice (Notepad++ works great).
	2b. Review settings. If there are any values you don't like, feel free to put the ";"
	at the beginning of the line to comment it out without erasing it (in case you decide
	you want it back later.)
3. Enjoy! :)
