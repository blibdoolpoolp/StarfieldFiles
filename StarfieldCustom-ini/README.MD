# Installation of StarfieldCustom.ini

### 1. Copy and paste StarfieldCustom.ini into your `<C:\Users\\\<Your Username\>\My Documents\My Games\Starfield>` folder.
### 2. (Optional) Open StarfieldCustom.ini in the text editor of your choice (Notepad++ works great), and review the settings. If there are any values you don't like, feel free to put a ";" (semicolon, no quotes) at the beginning of the line to comment it out and disable it without erasing it (in case you decide you want it back later.)
### 3. Enjoy! :)
